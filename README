Overview
========

nopdev is an extremely minimalistic Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) device
manager in the spirit of smdev (http://git.2f30.org/smdev/), but even simpler.

It is designed for monolithic kernels (i.e ones built without module loading
support) and requires a devtmpfs file system mounted at /dev.

nopdev does nothing except changing the ownership and permissions of device
nodes. It does not create device nodes and backwards-compatibility symlinks or
rename network interfaces.

Building
========

Copy config.def.h to config.h, modify it to your liking, then run:
  make

Usage
=====

To start nopdev, use the helper script:
  start-nopdev
